# Following class and decorator totally jacked from Jacob Zimmerman, with a few tweaks/renames
# https://programmingideaswithjake.wordpress.com/2015/05/23/python-decorator-for-simplifying-delegate-pattern/
# (I couldn't get the default copying of the entire baseclass dict to work, because that delegates __new__,
# which chokes on the non-subclass subclass. So just remove it for now)

# What this does: allows you to "subclass" an arbitrary baseclass by delegating certain methods/fields on
# your 'subclass' to the delegate-attribute without boilerplate for each individual method/field
# Equally valid interpretation of the same semantics: "subclass" a baseclass, but allows you to exclude
# certain methods from being used on the "subclass".
# Possible use cases include: making a read-only/immutable "subclass" of the builtin/superspeed dict

# Usage: define a attribute name on your subclass that is used as the proxy/delegator, and pass the methods
# you want available (or ignored) from the proxy on the main class into the decorator. See example below.
# (Your subclass is in charge of ensuring the delegator attribute exists and is a suitable instance of the
# baseclass, but everything else is automatic)
